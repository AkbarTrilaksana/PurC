1. files:
    basic_type.c: for all basic variant types
    variant_object.c: for object type
    variant_array.c: for array type
    variant_set.c:     for set type

    variant.c:  for initialize and destroy variant module,
                for all used, such as ref, unref, and creates variant from rwsteam.

    variant_internal.h: header file only for files in this directroy.

2. add and remove variant type:
    modify /Source/Purc/include/purc-variant.h, add type in purc_variant_type.
    modify /Source/Purc/include/purc-variant.h, add the interfaces for new type.
    modify /Source/Purc/variant/basic_type.c, for basic type or
    create /Source/Purc/include/variant_NewType.c, for abstract type.

3. add a function:
    If it is a internal interface for one file, write it in this file with static
    If it is for two or above files, wite is in variant.c and variant_internal.h
