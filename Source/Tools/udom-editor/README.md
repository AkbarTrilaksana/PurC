# uDOM Editor

A uDOM renderer in text-mode for HVML.

## Introduction

uDOM Editor (abbreviated as `UE`) is a uDOM renderer in text-mode for HVML.
It runs in a terminal or console like the famous
GNU [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/).

UE uses the utilties and widgets developed by MC (shorthand for
`Midnight Commander`), so we inherit the license of MC.
